# Discord Gemini Chat Bot

A multi-account Discord chat bot powered by Google Gemini AI, designed to engage in human-like conversations in a Discord channel. Features include topic detection, sentiment analysis, banned words handling, user profiling, and a professional yet casual tone.

## Features
- **Multi-Account Support**: Run up to 3 bot accounts simultaneously.
- **Colored Terminal Output**: Groups "Replying to" and "Sent" messages for clarity.
- **AI-Driven Responses**: Leverages Gemini AI for natural, context-aware, human-like replies.
- **Reply & Mention Priority**: Prioritizes responses to direct mentions and replies for engaging interactions.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports English, Hindi, Spanish, French, and German natively.
- **Conversation Memory**: Stores up to 50 past interactions in SQLite for smarter, context-rich conversations.
- **Customizable Slow Mode**: Configurable message scanning intervals via `.env` (e.g., `60,65` seconds).
- **Mood Variations**: Dynamic tones (excited, chill, sarcastic, etc.) with emojis used sparingly (~1 in 15 messages).
- **Personalization**: Uses `myinfo.txt` for tailored responses based on user-defined preferences.
- **Rate Limiting Handling**: Intelligent retry mechanism for Discord and Gemini API rate limits.
- **Duplicate Response Prevention**: Ensures no message is responded to more than once using SQLite and in-memory tracking.
- **Custom Response Pattern**: Enforces a 15-message cycle with ~3 single-word replies, ~11 short replies (1 sentence), and 1 long reply (2–4 sentences).
- **Robust Database Management**: Persistent SQLite connection with automatic reinitialization to prevent closure errors.
- **Banned Words Handling**: Sanitizes messages to avoid restricted words, maintaining safe interactions.

### Use Case: Level Up for Airdrops
One of the common use cases for this bot is **leveling up in Discord servers**. Many **airdrops** or events require users to gain levels or activity in certain Discord servers. By using the **Mee6 bot** or similar bots that track activity, you can **automatically generate messages** and **interact in channels**, helping you level up faster without manual input.

With the **Gemini AI-powered responses**, the bot can interact naturally in servers, completing tasks such as:
- Participating in chat and events.
- Responding to messages or mentions.
- Completing simple tasks that would otherwise require manual input.

This makes the **Discord Gemini Chat Bot** a powerful tool for automating your Discord experience and enhancing your **airdrops strategy** or **server activities**.
